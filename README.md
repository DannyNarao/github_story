Prompt: Simultaneously, across the world, everyone hears a voice in their head. "In 2 hours, the server will be shutting down for the final time. Thank you for playing Human Â®." 

First Paragraph:

The silence is broken by scattered whispers. "Did you hear that too?" "What's going on?" "This is a cruel joke." Phones go off, notifications alerting of breaking news.

Fourth Paragraph:
  Darkness falls across the town, lit by fires and street lights. Confusion and fear fills the slience. Tensions rise and riots begin to burst through the seams of tranquility. Unrest burdens us all with the weight of violence and terror. Is it all fake? Whats the point of trying? Are we all going to die? As questions continue to flood, blood continues to boil. Until, full system collapse, chaos...
